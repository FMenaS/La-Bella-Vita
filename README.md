## Motivation

Los Angeles dog shelters have been facing an overpopulation problem. One contributing factor is that owners are surrendering "disobedient" pets to local shelters. Most humans adopt dogs based on looks and don't research each breeds exercise needs.  I wanted to create a tool, that if answered honestly, would match humans to specific breeds based on their energy levels.

This application utilizes a quiz to match users with 10 compatible dog breeds. After the user selects a dog breed, the app then renders available dog adoptions, for that specific breed, using PetFinder's API.
